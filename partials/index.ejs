                        I am a software developer from New Jersey that makes nerdy apps for other nerds. For example, I made
                        Magic DeckMate, the most robust MTG token and counter game companion app on the iOS App Store. That's
                        pretty nerdy.

                            Switch Kick: A basic striking technique in which a martial artist attempts to kick his/her opponent
                            from a side that the opponent does not expect by first switching the position of the feet. Success
                            can be achieved with this technique by leveraging calculated preparation and recognizing opportunities
                            that others would not even know exist.
